# Calculator
Calculator project done for TOP. A project testing all that I've learned thus far. There were definitely challenges in making this project. I spent many hours trying to figure out how to get this thing to work. I failed so many times during this project, wiping my slate clean and starting from scratch over and over, learning something new each time. I'm very excited and eager to learn more from here, to both create new, better projects, and to improve upon previous ones.
